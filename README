T64Backup.sh
============

This script is a simple Shell based backup script for Tru64 Unix 5.1 systems.
I wrote it in the pasts to backup to a local tapedrive. It's not perfect and
maybe will never work for you ;)


Features
--------

 * Shell script uses Tru64 Unix vdump and mt commands
 * A simple tape lable for identification
 * Send status emails
